# DIFFICULTY: EASY
# ----------------
#
# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
#
# Return the running sum of nums.

    SOLUTION
    --------

    This is known as a prefix sum.

    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum

    COMPLEXITY
    ----------

    Time complexity is O(n) because we are iterating through the list once.

    Space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the prefix sum array.
