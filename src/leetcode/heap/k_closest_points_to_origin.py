# DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
#
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the
# k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
#
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
#
# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

        SOLUTION
        --------

        The request for "k-closest" indicates you'll want a heap.  Using a either a min heap or max heap will work.

        With a min heap, just jam all the points on the heap and then slice the first k elements.  This requires storing
        all the points on the heap.

        With a max heap, you can jam points on the heap until you have k elements.  Then, when you have a new point,
        compare it to the max element on the heap.  If it's closer, pop off the max element and jam it on the heap;
        otherwise, ignore it.

        The max heap approach can be more efficient, so we'll go that route.

        COMPLEXITY
        ----------

        Time complexity is O(n log k) with a max heap, which will be faster when k is much smaller than n.  If we go
        with the min heap approach, it's O(n log n).

        Space complexity is O(n).
